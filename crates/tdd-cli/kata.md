# Kata Description

Write a clear description of the kata you want to practice here.
The autonomous TDD machine will use this as context for generating tests and implementations.

## Example

Implement a string calculator that:
- Takes a string of comma-separated numbers and returns their sum
- Returns 0 for an empty string
- Handles newlines between numbers
- Supports custom delimiters
